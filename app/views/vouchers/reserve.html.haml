      Sorry, but there are no shows for which this ticket can be redeemed
      at this time.  This could be because:
    %ul
      %li All shows for which it's valid may be sold out
      %li All seats allocated for this type of ticket may be sold out 
      %li Seats allocated for this type of ticket may not be available for reservation until a future date
